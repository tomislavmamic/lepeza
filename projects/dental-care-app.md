### **Overview**

Denther is an app that provides quality dental services online.

### **Problem Statement**

Patients donâ€™t know if they are getting the right dental diagnosis. If they want another opinion they would need to meet more dentists in person. That means big expenses and a waste of time going from one to another dentist. Because of that, we needed to design a digital workspace for dentists to annotate dental images and create diagnoses for patients. The dental workspace needed to be as much clear to understand as possible so that dentists can easily give a diagnosis that would have even better quality than giving a diagnosis in person.

#### **Users & Audience**

Denther is made for **patients** who need more opinions for reinsurance. They want better and easier tracking of dental health.

Furthermore, the app is for **dentists** who want to give the best diagnosis that they can.

**Insurance companies** are also a big part of Denther because this app will reduce fraud in the dental industry and expenses for them.

Denther is for **dental photographers** who wants to provide best quality photos for patients and dentist.

Also, the app is for **X-ray providers** who want to provide X-rays for all patients and dentists who are involved with Denther.
